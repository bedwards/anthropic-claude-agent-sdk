  "content": "You stand at the edge of Willowmere village, gazing up at the mist-shrouded peak of Mount Drakenthorn. For generations, tales have been told of the ancient dragon Pyraxis who guards a treasure beyond imagination in his mountain lair.\n\nThe village elder approaches you, her weathered face etched with concern. \"Many have sought the dragon's gold,\" she says, \"but none have returned. The mountain path is treacherous, and Pyraxis... he is cunning beyond measure.\"\n\nShe presses a worn leather map into your hands. \"If you must go, know this: the dragon values wisdom over strength. There may be more than one way to claim your fortune.\"\n\nThe morning sun breaks through the clouds, casting long shadows across the cobblestone square. Your adventure begins.",
