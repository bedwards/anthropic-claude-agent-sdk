  "content": "You float in the observation deck of the ESS Endeavor, humanity's first deep-space research vessel, currently positioned at the edge of the Kuiper Belt. The stars shine with an intensity you've never seen from Earth—cold, ancient, and indifferent.\n\nThree months into your solo six-month mission, the loneliness has become a tangible thing. You've grown accustomed to the hum of the life support systems, the soft beeps of automated diagnostics, the sound of your own breathing in the silence.\n\nThen, at 0347 ship time, everything changes.\n\nYour console erupts with alerts. An incoming signal—not random cosmic noise, but a structured transmission. Mathematical. Deliberate. Impossible.\n\nThe signal originates from a region of space 4.3 light-years away, somewhere in the direction of Proxima Centauri. But the transmission delay suggests it was sent recently—impossibly recently. Either someone broke the laws of physics, or they sent it long ago knowing exactly when you'd be here to receive it.\n\nYour hands tremble as you study the data. This is first contact. This is what humanity has dreamed of for centuries. And you're alone, millions of kilometers from Earth, with a decision to make.\n\nMission protocols are clear: report immediately to Earth and await instructions. But the 40-minute communication delay means you'd be waiting over an hour for a response. The signal repeats every 11 minutes, and there's something in its structure—a question? An invitation? A warning?\n\nYour fingers hover over the console. What will you do?",
